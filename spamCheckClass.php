# Description:
# This class helps check for user spam activity across several DNS blacklist
# providers such as sorbs, spamhaus, and others. This class uses built in 
# functions and reverse dns lookup to determine the possibility of spam behavior of a user.
# Great for vetting users on any platform.
# To use: embed class in your app and call spamCheck class and blacklistCheck() to perform lookup.
